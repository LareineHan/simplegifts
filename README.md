# ⭐️ SimpleGifts ⭐️

**SimpleGifts** is a lightweight application I developed out of a personal need. Often, I would encounter recurring issues or challenges that had surprisingly simple solutions. For instance, commands like `git commit -m 'first commit'` are seemingly trivial, but can be essential in the moment. I wanted a dedicated, easily accessible, and private space to store such tidbits of information. Thus, SimpleGifts was born. It's designed for jotting down ideas, notes, errors, or memos with a title and description. Think of it as your digital sticky note pad, but tailored for those "a-ha!" moments and solutions, making organizing and recalling information a breeze.

# Features

- **Add Notes**: Quickly add notes with a title and a detailed description.
- **Delete Notes**: Get rid of notes you no longer need with a simple click on the trash icon.
- **Heart Your Notes**: Found a note particularly useful? Give it a heart! 
- **Sorting**: Rearrange your notes based on different criteria to find what you need faster.
- **Code Insertion**: For those technical notes or to store code snippets, you can easily insert code using markdown-style backticks \``` \```.

# Usage

1. **Add a New Note**:
   - Click on the '+' icon.
   - Enter your note's title and description.

2. **Delete a Note**:
   - Find the note you wish to delete.
   - Click on the trash icon associated with that note.

3. **Heart a Note**:
